## Anti-Adjective Editor

A plain-text editor with one function: to highlight adjective and adverb use and ergonomically provide alternatives in the form of verbs or nouns.

### Justification

Adjectives are static:

“I would recommend to all storytellers a watchful attitude and a thoughtful, careful choice of adjectives and adverbs, because the bakery shop of English is rich beyond belief, and narrative prose, particularly if it’s going a long distance, needs more muscle than fat.” -- Ursula K. Le Guin

They should, when possible, be replaced with a more-precise verb or noun that already has the adjective implicit in it:

"It is nouns and verbs, not their assistants, that give good writing its toughness and color.” -- E.B. White

"All fine prose is based on the verbs carrying the sentences. They make sentences move." -- F. Scott Fitzgerald

“All nouns are abbreviations. Instead of saying cold, sharp, burning, unbreakable, shining, pointy, we utter ‘dagger’; for the receding sun and oncoming darkness, we say ‘twilight.’” -- Jorge Luis Borges

In practice, a tool like this is more useful for practice minimizing adjective use in your instinctual writing flow, rather than for composing an entire piece of work within. Adjectives, used sparingly, enrich good clean prose and should not be banished altogether.
